supercell:  Generates a large supercell out of a given small cell. The program
            reads a file POSCAR for the unit cell and requests a transform matrix
            that transform the unit cell into a super cell. 
            The program generates a file POSCAR_SUPER containing
            all atomic coordinates of the supercell
