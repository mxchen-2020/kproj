1) Under the directory ./gen, I used the program supercell to generate the a 5x5 supercell of graphene.
   The tranformation matrix for the generation of the supercell is:
   5 0 0
   0 5 0
   0 0 1
   The geometric structure of the generated supercell is given in POSCAR_SUPER
   Then I removed 10st carbon atom to get the structure of the defected graphene and remove the corresponding translation vectors in the pos_map.dat file.
   note : The number of atoms in the supercell in the pos_map.dat should to be changed to 49.
   (see ./gen/pos2stru/POSCAR and ./gen/pos2stru/pos_map.dat).
   The program supercell can be found under the directory utils. Make it before using.

2) I renamed POSCAR_SUPER to POSCAR and used the pos2stru program to convert it to STRU. (see ./gen/pos2stru)
   Then, I did a scf calculation using STRU.

3) I did the band calculation by representing the high symmetry point of the unit cell in the reciprocal lattice vectors of the supercell.

4) Under ./OUT.ABACUS, I first run_futils to get the data on a grid for plotting.
   Then, I did the plot using gnuplot, i.e., gnuplot plotbnds.gnu. (see ./OUT.ABACUS/plotbnds_up.eps)
   Note that I have modified file plotbnds.gnu to set the names of the high symmetry points correctly.
   Likewise, run_futils has to be done first for the plotting using opendx.
