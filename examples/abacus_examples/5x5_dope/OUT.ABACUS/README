1. Process the KPOINTS file using the supercell lattice vectors to describe the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone of the primitive cell.

Such as M:(0.5, 0.5, 0)
|5 0 0||0.5|  |2.5|
|0 5 0||0.5|= |2.5|
|0 0 1||0.0|  |0.0|


2. Perform the band calculation and output the wavefunction file.

3. Prepare the input file INKPROJ for the band unfolding.

4. Copy the pos_map.dat file here and perform the band unfolding calculation.
./kproj
