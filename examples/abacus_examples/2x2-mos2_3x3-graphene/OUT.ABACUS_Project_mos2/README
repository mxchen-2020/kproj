1. Process the KPOINTS file using the supercell lattice vectors to describe the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone of the primitive cell.

2. Perform the band calculation and output the wavefunction file.

3. Prepare the input file INKPROJ for the band unfolding.

4. Copy the pos_map.dat file here and perform the band unfolding calculation.
./kproj
