All examples in this directory are based on the LCAO method

1) 5x5_defect , an example of band unfolding for defected graphene.

2) 5x5_dope , an example of band unfolding for doping an oxygen atom in graphene.

3) 5x5_replace , an example of band unfolding for replacing a carbon atom by an oxygen atom in graphene.

4) 2x2-mos2_3x3-graphene, an example of dealing with heterostructure.
   I project the wavefunctions onto MoS2 and graphene respectively with layer k-projection method.
