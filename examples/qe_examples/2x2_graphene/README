1) First, I generated a 2x2 of graphene using the program supercell.
   The transformation matrix is:
   2  0  0
   0  2  0
   0  0  1

2) Then I did the scf and band calculations. 
   Note that M (0.5, 0, 0) and K (1/3, 1/3, 0) in the BZ of the 1 x 1 cell are represented by the reciprocal lattice vectors of the supercell,
   which are (1.0, 0, 0) and (2/3, 2/3, 0), respectively (see tutorial for more details).

3) Then, I projected the wavefunctions onto different regions to examine the distribution of the bands in real space.(see ./layer_0.4_0.5 and ./layer_0.8_0.9)
