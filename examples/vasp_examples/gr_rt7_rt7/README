1) First, I generated a sqrt(7) x sqrt(7) of graphene using the program supercell.
   The transform matrix is:
   3  1  0
  -1  2  0
   0  0  1

2) Then I did the scf and band calculations. 
   Note that M (0, 0.5, 0) and K (1/3, 1/3, 0) in the BZ of the 1 x 1 cell are represented by the reciprocal lattice vectors of the supercell,
   which are (0.5, 1.0, 0) and (4/3, 1/3, 0), respectively (see tutorial for more details).
