1) gr_rt7_rt7, an example of band unfolding for a simple supercell of graphene.
 
2) defected_graphene, an example of band unfolding for defected graphene.
   For this system, the layer projection was not used. 
   That is, the wavefunctions over the whole space are used for the calculation of the weights of the k-projected wavefunctions.
   This is usually done for bulk.
   In addition, an example of splitting the band calculation for large systems is given under the directory band_split.

3) Ge_Al2O3, an example of dealing with interfaces.
   I split the band calculation into four since the system is large.

4) 2x2-mos2_3x3-graphene , an example of dealing with heterostructure.
   I project the wavefunctions onto MoS2 and graphene respectively with layer k-projection method.
