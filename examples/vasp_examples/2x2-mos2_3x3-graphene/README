1) In this example, I generated a 2x2 MoS2 supercell and a 3x3 graphene supercell. 
   Therefore, the transformation matrix from the unit cell to the supercell is
   graphene:  3  0  0     MoS2: 2  0  0 
              0  3  0           0  2  0
              0  0  1           0  0  1
   Then, I combined them to form a heterostructure.(see ./gen_structure/hetro/POSCAR) 

2) Then, I did a scf calculation using POSCAR and band calculation with KPOINTS_Graphene and KPOINTS_MoS2 respective.

3) I used the layer k-projection method to project the wavefunctions onto graphene and MoS2, respectively.(see ./band/proj_to_graphene and ./band/proj_to_mos2)

4) Note that the transformation matrix of graphene and MoS2 are different, when projecting onto different layers,
   the corresponding transformation matrix and zlay1/zlay2 should be specified in INKPROJ correctly.
