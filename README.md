# KPROJ: A Band Unfolding Program
This program is currently interfaced to VASP. It can do band unfoldings for both bulk and interface systems modelled in supercells. For interfaces, it uses a technique combining FFT and back FFT, which accelerates the calculation significantly. The program allows us to investigate properties of electronic states in any spatial region (defined by zlay1 and zlay2) including the vacuum region for slabs, which is helpful for understanding ARPES and STM/STS experiments.
